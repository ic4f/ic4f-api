title: "Plant DNA detection from grasshopper gut contents... published!"
---

My paper “Plant DNA detection from grasshopper gut contents: a step-by-step protocol, from tissues
preparation to obtaining plant DNA sequences” has just been accepted for publication in Applications
in Plant Sciences!<!--more-->

It will come out in February 2014. This paper describes a protocol for isolating plant food DNA from
insect guts, developed specifically for grasshoppers. It is a very convenient and relatively quick
PCR-based method which allows accurate confirmation of food consumption by insect herbivores. Given
that grasshoppers are important agricultural pests and dominate insect herbivores in the grasslands,
knowledge of their feeding preferences is critical for both crop management and landscape
restoration.

The paper includes this video which I made to illustrate the main steps of dissecting a grasshopper.

I am currently applying this protocol to exploring grasshoppers’ feeding choices with regard to
native and exotic plant species, which is another application of this method – to help managers to
effectively control invasive plants and/or predict invasion.
